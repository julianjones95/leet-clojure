# Learning Clojure Using Leetcode

This repository is a good stepping stone for a beginner learning Clojure. It is
a known fact that Clojure has a steep learning curve. This repository is a
useful tool for a new Clojurian to get started learning the syntax.

## Structure

Below is the learning structure I followed when making this repository. It is
important to note some weeks only contain 1 topic. This is because I found
that understanding of said topic was strategically important for comprehension
of future topics.
